## Getting Started

Developers can check out from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matthiasmiller/javascriptlint).

You can run JavaScript Lint several ways:

* You can integrate it into your IDE, such as Visual Studio, SciTE, or any other IDE supporting external tools. When JavaScript Lint finds an error, your IDE takes you directly to the line containing the error.

* You can run it through Windows Explorer, which Windows programmers may prefer.

* You can use the command line to integrate into your build system, or maybe you're a Linux programmer and simply prefer the command line!

* Additionally, if you are a software developer, you may want to integrate into your Windows program or run it from your PHP website to take advantage of the full power of JavaScript Lint.

JavaScript Lint continues to be improved. If you encounter problems or have suggestions or revisions, please visit the project forum and tracker.

## Acknowledgements
We all stand on the shoulders of giants. I would like to especially acknowledge Douglas Crockford's work on JSLint. This lint is itself written in JavaScript and is an interesting and rather sophisticated script. Crockford's ideas about good coding practices served as a springboard for many of these lint rules.
